# HongXiongMao 红熊猫

hóngxióngmāo (hxm) is a Multi-Asset Portfolio Management toolkit. In the Spirit of dry (don't repeat yourself) coding it is built as the Pythonic lube for my Pontificating Panda chartbook and other Python projects. It is a **work in progress** so I make no promises about the accuracy of any module or model, with that said feel free to fork or adopt any of this code as you see fit (subject to licenses and diclaimers).

## Setup
We can install or upgrade badgertools directly from github using pip
```
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/hongxiongmao#egg=hongxiongmao
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/hongxiongmao#egg=hongxiongmao --upgrade
```
For more information the article [How to use GitHub as a PyPi server](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2/) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) is worth a read.

The ultimate objective is to have this library installable via PyPi but the current rate of change makes that a slight waste of time.
