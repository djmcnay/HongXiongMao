# badgertools

In the spirit of dry (don't repeat yourself) programming, I provide badgertools as the Pythonic lube for my Pontificating Panda chartbook and other Python projects.

## Setup
We can install or upgrade badgertools directly from github using pip
```
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/badgertools#egg=badgertools
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/badgertools#egg=badgertools --upgrade
```
For more information the article [How to use GitHub as a PyPi server](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2/) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) is worth a read.
