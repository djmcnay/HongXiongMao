# HongXiongMao 红熊猫

![Placeholder Red Panda Banner from Google till I make my own](https://apps2.wwf.org.hk/pandashop/images/red_panda_banner.jpg)

In the spirit of dry (don't repeat yourself) programming, I provide hóngxióngmāo (hxm) as the Pythonic lube for my Pontificating Panda chartbook and other Python projects.



## Setup
We can install or upgrade badgertools directly from github using pip
```
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/hongxiongmao#egg=hongxiongmao
! pip install git+https://github.com/djmcnay/hongxiongmao#egg=hongxiongmao --upgrade
```
For more information the article [How to use GitHub as a PyPi server](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2/) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) is worth a read.

The ultimate objective is to have this library installable via PyPi but the current rate of change makes that a slight waste of time.
